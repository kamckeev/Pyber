# Pyber
(matplotlib homework, Pyber edition)

This project anylazes data of a fictional ride-share company (Pyber) with bubble charts and pie chartes to determine:
*Average fare per city
*Total number of drivers per city
*Total number of rides per city
*City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)
*Percentage of total fares, rides, and drivers by city type

After reviewing the data, it is easy to see that the greatest percent of the company's drivers, as well as the greatest providers of rides, come from the Urban city-type. Additionally, rural drivers represent the smallest percentage of the company's drivers. 

While the combination of Rural and Suburban cities represent about 35% of both rides and fares, they only represent 22% of the total amount of Pyber drivers. 

By looking at the bubble chart, where the size of the bubbles scale with the average drivers per city, its easy to see how the cities with the most drivers also gave the greatest quantity of rides. There seems to be an inverse correlation between the quantity of drivers and the average fare for the different city types. The Urban enviroments has the greatest density of drivers and the lowest average fare price. The Rural enviroments have the lowest concentration of drivers, but have the highest average fare. Competition drives rates down but also increases the frequency the Pyber service is used.
